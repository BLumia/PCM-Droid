## Notice

Still WIP.

## What's this?

This is a client side implement of [Private Cloud Music](https://github.com/BLumia/Private-Cloud-Music), with multiple server switching support.

## More

This is my first android application. Contributions are always welcome, just send me a PR or open an issue...

No license for now... When the app is ready for a stable release, I'll choose a lax permissive license for it just like the [Private Cloud Music](https://github.com/BLumia/Private-Cloud-Music) does.

## TODO

- [ ] Add server setup page actually do a setup(with `pcm://` schema support).
- [ ] Allowd hide server icon sidebar when user only add one server to PCM-droid app.
- [ ] Server icon sidebar rework(so ugly now).
- [ ] Edit existing server info.
- [ ] Save song to local storage when playback using wifi / allowd user download song to local storage.
- [ ] Playlist mode support.
- [ ] MediaSession support.
- [ ] Language switcher.
